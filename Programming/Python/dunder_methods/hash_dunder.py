# The `__hash__()` method returns a unique integer (hash) for an object, allowing it to be used in hash-based collections like sets and dictionaries.
""" How __hash__() Works
1. It is used when an object is added to hash-based data structures (set, dict keys).
2. If two objects are equal (__eq__() is True), they must have the same hash.
3. If __hash__() is not implemented, mutable objects (like lists) cannot be dictionary keys. """
