# What is HTTP ? 
- HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is an application-layer protocol that enables web browsers and servers to communicate and share information over the internet .

- HTTP operates as a request-response protocol, where a client, such as a web browser, sends a request to a server, and the server responds with the requested data. This protocol supports various operations, including fetching web pages, images, videos, and posting content to servers.

- Basically request is just like a message that client/frontend(commonly browser) send to backend.
- In JavaScript we can use `XMLHttpRequest`  class to creates a new HTTP message or request object. This object is used to make requests to servers(backend or we can say API) and retrieve(get) data or post data , patch , etc..., from that server.   
**XMLHttpRequest** , is explained in another file , `xmlHttpRequest.md` in JavaScript folder .
